Test::More::Behaviour - BDD module for Perl

  cpan -i Test::More::Behaviour

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  describe 'Bank Account' => sub {
    context 'transferring money' => sub {
      it 'withdrawals amount from the source account' => sub {
        my $source = BankAccount->new(100);
        my $target = BankAccount->new(0);
        $source->transfer(50, $target);
        is($source->balance, 50);
      };
      it 'deposits amount into target account' => sub {
        my $source = BankAccount->new(100);
        my $target = BankAccount->new(0);
        $source->transfer(50, $target);
        is($target->balance, 50);
      };
    };
  };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::More::Behaviour is a Behaviour-Driven Development module for Perl programmers.  It is modeled after Rspec (F<http://rspec.info>) the infamous BDD tool for Ruby programmers.

Because Test::More::Behaviour uses Test::More as its 'base', you can treat every Test::More::Behaviour test as if it were Test::More!

=head1 QUICK REFERENCE

This project is built with the philosophy that 'Tests are the Documentation'.  For a full set of features, please read through the test scenarios.

=over

=item B<describe>

Used to group a set of examples of a particular behaviour of the system that you wish you describe.

=item B<it>

An example to run.

=item B<context>

Used to further establish deeper relations for a set of examples.  This is best used when several examples have similar interactions with the system but have differring expectations.

=item B<before_all>

=item B<before_each>

=item B<after_each>

=item B<after_all>

Used to define code which executes before and after each example or only once per example group.

=head1 SOURCE

The source code for Test::More::Behaviour can be found at F<https://github.com/bostonaholic/test-more-behaviour>

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Currently, each `it` will not run as a Test::More::subtest.  This is because the coloring was not working correctly because subtest needed the description before evaluating the block passed in.  If you can fix this, please submit a github pull request and I will take a look.

If you do find any bugs, please send me an email or send me a github pull request with a broken test (and your fix if you're able to) and I will be more than happy to fix.
