=head1 NAME

Test::More::Behaviour - BDD module for Perl

=head1 INSTALL

  cpan -i Test::More::Behaviour

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::More::Behaviour is a Behaviour-Driven Development module for Perl
programmers.  It is modeled after Rspec (F<http://rspec.info>), the BDD tool for Ruby programmers.

Because Test::More::Behaviour uses Test::More as its 'base', you can treat every Test::More::Behaviour test as if it were Test::More!

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 Basic structure

Test::More::Behaviour uses the words `describe` and `it` so we can
express concepts of the application as we would in conversation:

  "Describe a bank account."
  "It transfers money between two accounts."

code:

  describe 'Bank Account' => sub {
      it 'transfers money between two accounts' => sub {
          my $source = BankAccount->new(100);
          my $target = BankAccount->new(0);
          $source->transfer(50, $target);

          is($source->balance, 50);
          is($target->balance, 50);
      };
  };

Then the output should be:

    Bank Account
       transfers money between two accounts

The `describe` subroutine takes a description and a block. Inside the
block you can declare examples using the `it` subroutine.

=head2 Nested groups

You can also declare nested groups using the  `describe` or `context`
subroutines.

  describe 'Bank Account' => sub {
      context 'when opening without an initial amount' => sub {
          it 'has an initial balance of 0' => sub {
              ...
          };
      };

      context 'when opening with an initial amount of 100' => sub {
          it 'has an initial balance of 100' => sub {
              ...
          };
      };
  };

=head1 QUICK REFERENCE

This project is built with the philosophy that 'Tests are the Documentation'.  For a full set of features, please read through the test scenarios.

Some examples are listed with the source code (F<https://github.com/bostonaholic/test-more-behaviour>) under `examples/`.

=item B<describe>

Used to group a set of examples of a particular behaviour of the
system that you wish you describe.

  describe 'Bank Account' sub => {
      ...
  };

=item B<it>

An example to run.

  describe 'Bank Account' => sub {
      it 'transfers money between two accounts' => sub {
          ...
      };
  };

=item B<context>

Used to further establish deeper relations for a set of examples.  This is best used when several examples have similar interactions with the system but have differring expectations.

  describe 'Bank Account' => sub {
      context 'when opening without an initial amount' => sub {
          it 'has an initial balance of 0' => sub {
              ...
          };
      };

      context 'when opening with an initial amount of 100' => sub {
          it 'has an initial balance of 100' => sub {
              ...
          };
      };
  };

=item B<before_all>

=item B<after_all>

These subroutines will run before and after all the `it` examples.

  sub before_all {
      ...
  };
    
  sub after_all {
      ...
  };

  describe 'Bank Account' => sub {
      it 'transfers money between two accounts' => sub {
          ...
      };
  };

=item B<before_each>

=item B<after_each>

Used to define code which executes before and after each `it` example.

  sub before_each {
      ...
  };
    
  sub after_each {
      ...
  };

  describe 'Bank Account' => sub {
      it 'transfers money between two accounts' => sub {
          ...
      };
  };

=head1 SOURCE

The source code for Test::More::Behaviour can be found at F<https://github.com/bostonaholic/test-more-behaviour>

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Currently, each `it` will not run as a Test::More::subtest.  This is because the coloring was not working correctly because subtest needed the description before evaluating the block passed in.  If you can fix this, please submit a github pull request and I will take a look.

If you do find any bugs, please send me an email or create a github issue (F<https://github.com/bostonaholic/test-more-behaviour/issues>) or pull request with a failing test (and your fix if you're able to) and I will be more than happy to fix.
